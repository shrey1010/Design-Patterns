## Design Patterns

### üîπ Creational Design Patterns

What is the Singleton Pattern? Can you implement a Singleton class in Python?

Explain the Factory Pattern with a simple real-world example.

When would you use the Abstract Factory Pattern? Give a basic use case.

What is the Builder Pattern? How is it useful in constructing complex objects?

Explain the Prototype Pattern. How can cloning objects be beneficial?

### üîπ Structural Design Patterns

What is the Decorator Pattern? Can you show how to add features to a class dynamically in Python?

Explain the Adapter Pattern with a real-world analogy.

What is the Facade Pattern? How does it simplify complex systems?

How does the Proxy Pattern work? Give a simple use case (like access control).

What is the Composite Pattern? How would you represent a tree-like structure using it?

Explain the Bridge Pattern. How does it help in decoupling abstraction from implementation?

What is the Flyweight Pattern? When would you use it to optimize memory usage?

### üîπ Behavioral Design Patterns

What is the Observer Pattern? Can you explain it using a publish-subscribe example?

Explain the Strategy Pattern. How can it help in selecting algorithms at runtime?

What is the Command Pattern? How would you implement an Undo-Redo feature using it?

Describe the Template Method Pattern with a simple example (e.g., preparing different types of tea/coffee).

What is the Iterator Pattern? How does Python's iterator protocol relate to it?

Explain the State Pattern. How can it help manage object states (like in a Vending Machine)?

What is the Chain of Responsibility Pattern? Give a basic example (like handling requests through middleware).

Explain the Mediator Pattern. How does it simplify communication between objects?

What is the Memento Pattern? How can you implement a simple "Save" and "Restore" functionality?

Describe the Visitor Pattern. When would you use it to perform operations on object structures?

What is the Interpreter Pattern? Can you give an example where it‚Äôs useful (e.g., parsing simple expressions)?
